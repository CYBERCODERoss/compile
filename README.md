 - THIS SCRIPT USES SIMPLE BASH CODE TO COMPILE THE PROGRAM AND THEN RUN IT IMMEDIATELY JUST IN ONE CLICK
 - IF YOU ARE FED UP OF WRITING "g++ -/filename.cpp -o -/output.cpp" AND THEN AGAIN RUNNING "./output.cpp" THEN USE THIS REPO.


_________________________________

   OS requirement:
_________________________________

 - THIS REQUIRES LINUX DISTRIBUTION LIKE KALI LINUX , UBUNTU , PARROT and their equivalents.
 - YOU CAN RUN IT ON WINDOWS AS WELL BUT LINUX IS MOST PREFERABLE.

   How to use it?
_________________________________


                    - *^MUST NOTICE^*
                    - YOUR EXECUTABLE FILE MUST BE IN THIS FOLDER YOI CAN DO THIS BY 2 METHODS
                    - 1 by using mouse click "copy , paste"
                    - 2 by using the terminal commands as follow:
                    - To copy one file into a folder using the Kali Linux terminal, you can use the cp command. The basic syntax for copying a file into a folder is as follows:

cp <source_file> <destination_folder>


                  - Let's say you have a file named example.txt that you want to copy into a folder named my_folder located in your home directory. The command would be:
cp example.txt ~/my_folder
                  - This will copy the example.txt file into the my_folder directory in your home directory.

                  - Note that if the destination folder doesn't exist, the cp command will create it for you. If the destination folder already contains a file with the same name as the source file, the cp command will overwrite it without any warning.

                  - If you want to copy a file from one directory to another directory, you can specify the full paths:
cp /path/to/source_file /path/to/destination_folder

Replace /path/to/source_file and /path/to/destination_folder with the actual paths of your source file and destination folder.



- open the kali linux(or any linux distro.) terminal.
- run the following commands.

- $ sudo su     //enter password to use ROOT
- $ git clone https://github.com/CYBERCODERoss/compile.git
- $ cd compile
- $ chmod +x compile.sh
- $ ./compile.sh -/your_program_name.cpp

That's all your code is being compiled and runned if there are errors then this will tell you the errors as well.

   Advance info for COMPILER.SH?
_________________________________

- THIS IS THE ADVANCE VERSION OF THE PROJECT. WHERE TE CODE WILL GIVE YOU THE CHOICES FOR PYTHON AND BASH PROGRAM.
- YOU CAN CHOOSE 1 OR 2 (1 for python and 2 for bash)

                                      - YOU CAN USE IT BY FOLLOWING COMMANDS

- IF YOU HAD ALREADY CLONED THE REPO USING THE ABOVE GUIDANCE AT LINE 27 THEN NO NEED TO FOLLOW BELOW GUIDENCE. JUT RUN:
- $ chmod +x compiler.sh
- $ ./compiler.sh

                                                        -ELSE
- FOLLOW THIS 
- $ sudo su     //enter password to use ROOT
- $apt install python3 -y
- $ git clone https://github.com/CYBERCODERoss/compile.git
- $ cd compile
- $ chmod +x compiler.sh
- $ ./compiler.sh
- AND THEN FOLLOW THE GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS
That's it. YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPILED AND RUNN YOUR PROGRAM WITHOUT WASTING THE THE TIME ON RUNNING THE COMMANDS AGAIN AND AGAIN
